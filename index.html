      <h1>How to Get a 700 on SAT Math: A Realistic 40-Hour Study Plan</h1>
      <p class="small">
        If you’re aiming for a 700+ SAT Math score, the biggest mistake is assuming you need hundreds of hours or endless practice tests.
        Most students don’t fail from lack of effort — they fail from an unstructured approach that repeats the same mistakes.
      </p>
      <div class="note">
        <strong>Quick reality check:</strong> Getting to 700 on SAT Math is less about learning “more math” and more about building
        accuracy, pattern recognition, and a repeatable process for fixing your mistakes.
      </div>
    </header>

    <h2>Why students get stuck in the 600s</h2>
    <p>
      A lot of students can do the underlying math, but their scores don’t rise because the SAT rewards a specific kind of performance:
      consistent accuracy under time pressure, with fewer unforced errors. The 600s plateau usually happens when study time is spent
      “doing problems” without isolating <em>why</em> the same errors keep happening.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>They practice too broadly instead of targeting the few error patterns that cause most lost points.</li>
      <li>They review by redoing problems, not by diagnosing decision mistakes (misreads, traps, rushed steps).</li>
      <li>They don’t have a system that forces improvement week to week.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Why “more practice” stops working</h2>
    <p>
      Practice is necessary — but raw volume has diminishing returns. After a certain point, the same study routine produces the same score.
      That’s because the SAT isn’t testing creativity; it’s testing whether you can reliably avoid a set of predictable mistakes.
    </p>
    <p>
      If your review doesn’t change your future behavior, you’re collecting hours, not points. High scorers tend to do fewer problems
      than you’d think, but they extract more learning from each mistake:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>They use mostly official questions (because the patterns repeat).</li>
      <li>They track mistakes in a simple error log (so errors can’t hide).</li>
      <li>They practice in focused sets (so the lesson is obvious).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What actually breaks the 700 barrier</h2>
    <p>
      To get a 700 on SAT Math, you need a plan that produces three outcomes:
      (1) fewer careless errors, (2) faster recognition of common SAT structures, and (3) a pacing approach that keeps you calm and consistent.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Pattern-based thinking:</strong> recognizing the small set of question types and “moves” the SAT repeats.</li>
      <li><strong>Error-log review:</strong> treating mistakes as data, not as proof you’re “bad at math.”</li>
      <li><strong>Trap avoidance:</strong> learning what the test is trying to make you assume.</li>
      <li><strong>Accuracy before speed:</strong> speed improves naturally once decisions become cleaner.</li>
      <li><strong>Pacing rules:</strong> knowing when to move on and how to return efficiently.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>A realistic 40-hour framework</h2>
    <p>
      A “40-hour plan” works because it forces you to study efficiently. Instead of wandering through random topics, you follow a structure
      that prioritizes what moves your score the most:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Targeted concept cleanup:</strong> only the concepts you’re actually missing.</li>
      <li><strong>Official-question practice:</strong> because the SAT’s logic is consistent.</li>
      <li><strong>Daily review loop:</strong> mistakes go into an error log, then get corrected with a repeatable method.</li>
      <li><strong>Pacing practice:</strong> you learn how to finish without panic and avoid time-wasting battles.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The SAT Black Book is useful here because it teaches how the SAT “thinks” — but it can be overwhelming if you try to read it cover to cover.
      A better approach is to use it strategically as a framework while you practice and review official questions.
    </p>

    <h2>Who this is for (and who it’s not for)</h2>
    <p>
      This approach is best for students who are willing to follow a plan and do deliberate review — and for parents who want a structured,
      time-bounded path rather than open-ended tutoring.
